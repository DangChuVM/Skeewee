### Commit message

And that summarized:
 - Short and detailed
 - Prefix one of these commit types:
   - `feat:` A feature, possibly improving something already existing
   - `fix:` A fix, for example of a bug
   - `style:` Feature and updates related to styling
   - `refactor:` Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
   - `test:` Everything related to testing
   - `docs:` Everything related to documentation

(sadly sometimes more), and generally quicker development. Each (helpful) contribution that gets thankfully accepted,
gets noted down in the "About Modders" activity. We'll contact you how to note your contributions to Sketchware Pro.

## Disclaimer
This mod was not meant for any harmful purposes, such as harming Sketchware; Quite the opposite actually. It was made to keep Sketchware alive by the community for the community.
Please use it at your own discretion and buy the Sketchware Premium subscription every month to support the original Sketchware team, even if you don't use it. 

We love Sketchware very much, and we are grateful to Sketchware's developers for making such an amazing app, but unfortunately, we haven't received updates for a long time.
That's why we decided to keep Sketchware alive by making this mod, plus we don't demand any money, it's completely free. :\)
